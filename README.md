This is a Receipt database where we collect the invoices.
The goal is to collect data on the user and have them insert an invoice or receipt into the database.

What we need:
login			issue with multiple user login
register		done
active user		removed
add a new receipt	done
view receipt		doneish
modify data		nope
delete the data		doneish
search for the data	done



Login		-> New Data
		-> View Database
		-> Modify Database
		-> Delete Database

Register (done)	-> (First,Middle,Last) name, address,city,zip,phone,*AccountID,*Email,*Password

***************	Issues with this program	*****************
*Login only works for first user created (I don't know why)
*Creating the receipt not an issue but searching is
	Try fixing it, but broke the program. Might have something with the for loop issue?

*Cannot figure out about the tabbing issue.
